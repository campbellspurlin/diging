The Research Computing Expo will be held August 2-6, 2021 by Research Computing. The Digital Innovation Group will be contributing to the expo by hosting two workshops led by Taylor Quinn and Julia Damerow:

<p><strong>Introduction to Docker</strong></p>

Time: August 3rd, 2021, 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM

Description: Have you been given a script by a colleague and then ran into dependency errors while trying to run it? Docker seeks to solve this problem by creating a standard environment across all systems. It is a tool that allows you to run almost any application on your computer without installing heaps of dependencies first. Like most powerful tools, however, it might make you want to punt your computer at times. In this workshop we will try to limit the punt factor by explaining the basic concepts of Docker and how to use it. Participants will also get some hands-on experiences installing Docker, pulling images, and running containers (we will explain all these terms in the workshop!).

<p><strong>Git for Beginners</strong></p>

Time: August 5th, 2021, 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM

Description: In this workshop, participants will be introduced to Git, a popular version control system that lets you manage different versions of your files. We will first present the basic concepts of Git and how to use it. Then, the participants will do a self-paced tutorial that gives them hands-on experience with the Git command line. By the end of the workshop, participants should have a basic understanding of what Git and GitHub are as well as how and when to use it.
There are many more workshops related to Research Computing to choose from. More information and registration information can be found <a href= "https://asurc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/556204036/Workshops" target= "_blank">here</a>.
